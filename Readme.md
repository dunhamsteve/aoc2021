# Advent of Code 2021

This year I'm attempting AoC in Idris2, which I don't really know. A couple of days I fell back to Python for expediency or did Python first so I could see the full puzzle first, and work on the Idris solution at my leisure. The challenge here is that I don't know the language, don't know the libraries, and I've got a couple of decades of imperative programming behind me. 



## Notes on Individual Days

(backfilled on day 11)

Day 1
- Learned how to read files

Day 2

Day 3
- Bailed for python

Day 4
- Looks like I started to switch to python (beginnings of a parser) then switched back

Day 5
- I did this in python between parts 1/2
- Decided to take the dx/dy approach while in python land
- I changed the code for part two and left instructions to make the part 2 solution work for part 1

Day 7
- I think I did python first

Day 8
- Looks like I did it in python first and then Idris
- This was the day I had issues trying to figure out Bitset.bit and ended up with a case statement instead.
